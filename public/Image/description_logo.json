Some digital marketing agency  norms" you ll never see us adopting:
Using siloed strategies and teams
Starting with strong results but fizzling out over time
Focusing on acquiring new clients at the expense of existing clients
Struggling to retain and develop top talent marketers
Struggling to remain on the cutting edge of marketing advancements
Drowning in continual algorithm and platform updates
Lacking the visibility to execute effective strategies
We're not normal. We're disrupting our industry by not accepting the "norms" 
The Disruptive Difference:
Top Talent - We hire, develop, & retain top marketing talent so they can bring game-changing magic to our client’s accounts to help them reach their goals, make a positive impact on the world, and claim the leading edge in their industries!
Limited Client Count - We’re long-term growth partners with our clients; we limit our client count to ensure we only work with great companies.
No Silos - Our teams share learnings & collaborate to create multi-platform cohesive strategies. We drive results through meaningful marketing that aligns our tactics with your business goals.
We partner with you to understand the WHY behind your business, the GOALS you aspire to and the IMPACT this will have on your customers and business; we translate this into a unique full-funnel performance marketing strategy to get us there together.
Other stuff that should give you confidence that our actions speak louder than our words:
Over 1,000 positive reviews to date as a company
We manage hundreds of millions of dollars in digital advertising budgets annually
Over 50 local and national awards highlighting our industry dominance ;)
Over 120 employees that keep anonymously voting us a top place to work

You’ve never worked with an SEO partner like us. We help elite law firms & personal injury lawyers dominate first page rankings through search engine optimization. 

We can’t promise you that we’re the cheapest option available, but we can promise that no agency has a more experienced staff…or better results.

“The retainer I pay – without any hesitation – is the best ROI of any marketing dollar I spend. It’s the most cost effective way to get good, qualified cases.” ~ Stewart J. Guss, Attorney at Law

Delivering exceptional service and aggressive growth means limiting who we work with. Our clients are our partners: we implement quickly, communicate openly, and invest seriously to dominate the first page.

SEO is an investment; so is law school and studying for the bar. Many clients see a return on investment in as little as six months

When you’re thinking of hiring an SEO agency, you’re looking for who can produce results, execute at the highest level, and most importantly:

Deliver proof, not promises.

Our clients rank for keywords like:

“Houston Car Accident Lawyer” (Stewart J. Guss, Esq.)
	“Philadelphia Car Accident Lawyer” (Gabriel Levin, Esq.)
	“Chicago Car Accident Lawyer” (Dave Abels, Esq.)
We’ve even had a client rank on the first page nationwide for “car accident lawyer.”

The best in the industry trust us to deliver the rankings, traffic, and cases other firms can’t.

Accountability starts at the top. Most agencies hide behind excuses and jargon. They take your money, work hard for a month, then coast.

You deserve better; that’s why we exist.

We’re entrepreneurs helping entrepreneurs.

Back in 2008, the economic recession dealt crushing blows to small business owners everywhere.

Among those businesses affected were New Life Rockeries (owned and operated by Neil Eneix Sr.) Left with crippling debt and difficult choices, things seemed grim for the small landscaping business.

In an effort to help their family recover financially, his two oldest sons Keith and Neil Eneix began a small SEO company to help provide financial relief for the family.

Experiencing success through hard work, passion, and smarter marketing & sales systems Neil Eneix Sr was able to pull B&D Rockeries back into the green (no landscaping pun intended) and plant the seed that ultimately grew into our full-services marketing agency, Fannit! 

Our mission has stayed the same as it was back in 2008; we’re entrepreneurs helping entrepreneurs. With our deep experience in digital marketing, we help optimize sales and marketing machines so that companies reach new levels of growth!

We take an analytics-based approach to digital execution and are known for producing relevant brand experiences while also delivering the evidence to back up our successes. Our results-proven mix of cross-channel marketing, audience-centric creative, and data-backed strategies focused on engagement will present new opportunities well beyond the traditional days of impressions-driven programmatic and mass media buys.

 

HOW WE WORK

Most firms are virtual factories, where managers juggle dozens of accounts every day. This is a lose-lose situation. You re not happy in the end, and we don't have a relationship we're proud to stand by.

Each strategist is assigned a small handful of our account load, becoming an expert in every aspect of your business, and market movements. The work we do is labor-intensive, communication-intensive, and incredibly dynamic. Overloading our teams would make success impossible.

Preserving this service model requires us to be pragmatic in choosing client partners. We will objectively analyze your business, goals, and budget well before we negotiate terms. If we determine we can’t bring value to your or our methodology isn’t a good fit, we'll be honest. Consequently, should you choose us as your digital partner, you can be confident in our ability to deliver the results we promise.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/pbj.png"},{"description":"GUARANTEED RESULTS

Search is proven to be one of the highest converting media opportunities of possible marketing spends. Why? Because the advertising company captures the audience looking for the exact product or service at the exact moment they need it. They already have the sense of urgency built in. They need a phone number and a contact box to get a quote. What we do is put companies in front of the consumers by organic, paid and local search through Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (Pay Per Click Advertising) via Google AdWords & Bing Ads, Google Shopping, ReMarketing, Facebook Ads, and Google/Bing maps.

We build websites that not only look great but also perform, drive targeted actions and invite consumer interaction. Our sites have powerful tools that track, monitor, measure and test every visitor action and intention.

Once a consumer finds a company via search – they will also check their online reputation. 79% of consumers trust online reviews as much a personal recommendation so it’s very important to showcase your happy clients. When you seamlessly integrate all these aspects – the results are powerful. You have increased customers, sales and company growth.

We help leaders understand how their efforts are working with their customer experience, so they can reinforce what works and eliminate what doesn’t.

 

Our goal for clients is performance. For us, that means designing a digital experience that:

 

Keeps up with technology, expectations, and your business.
	Blows customers  minds; it is so easy to use.
	Actually helps you achieve the marketing goals you set.
	Brings in the marketing budget to get your new ideas approved and running.
But designing that experience starts with one question: 

Are you working for your website, or is your website working for you?

 

We believe technology exists to make your life easier, and that notion drives our design process. So whether you want to increase sales or streamline your internal processes, we craft solutions to eliminate your challenges. Of course, that starts with deeply understanding your challenges at play.

 

Our strengths include UX/UI design, ecommerce development, analytics, and SEO. Our weaknesses are PR and writing Clutch profiles.

 

We partner with leaders who want to do digital better.

****SEO****

You have worked hard to create a website full of valuable content, but you do not see the expected traffic or results. 

It s incredibly frustrating when you put so much effort into something and don't see the returns you were hoping for. You're not alone. Many businesses experience this same problem with their website.

That's where our game-changing SEO Supercharge service comes in. 

We’re so confident that we can help improve the visibility of your website that we have a 100% money-back guarantee. No one can guarantee a #1 ranking on Google. But after 20+ years of building and growing websites, we are willing to assume the risk and guarantee your results!

Recent examples from real clients - A 22,640% improvement (not a typo) in visibility. That's exceptionally high, we admit. But another client has seen an 1122% improvement. These are just 2 examples of many.

 

****WEBSITES****

This is where it all starts. The only digital property you actually own (no, you don't own your Instagram page...Meta does). Mess up your website, and it doesn't matter what else you do for SEO, ads, or social media because you will never maximize value (revenue) from that traffic.

Our website services are designed to be efficient, affordable, and thorough. Our approach keeps you in control of the project and what we're working on.

 

***Your Success Is Our Success*** 

Our formula is simple: 

You run your business + we run your website + we manage your digital identity = your business grows.

At Aspire, we know the pressure of needing to attract a steady stream of new leads and customers. And we believe you shouldn’t be paying for marketing that doesn’t deliver. You deserve great ROI.

That’s why we took our decades of experience leading successful marketing campaigns for SMBs–and several Fortune 500 companies–and created Aspire Marketing Group. Our process for better ROI is simple:

1. Request a free marketing assessment. You’ll get some valuable tips, and we’ll tell you if we think we can help you. If so, and if you want to proceed…

2. Order a customized marketing plan. We’ll do a 6-8 week deep dive, resulting in a detailed roadmap for marketing success that comes with a money-back guarantee.

3. Invite us to execute your plan. Once we ve won your trust, hire us. You’ll get a “fractional marketing department” with all the marketing & RevOps skills your business needs.

You don’t have to settle for desperate marketing efforts that are generic and random. And you sure don’t have to stress over expensive marketing that doesn’t bring in revenue.

Aspire can you give you a smart, customized marketing strategy. And our team can deliver better ROI – more website visitors, more quality leads, and more revenue. We’ll work for you with the same dedication, passion, and quality you’d expect from an employee. You’ll get digital marketing that makes you stand out–and makes customers want to do business with you.

Our story

Our story began as a 1-person graphic design agency but we quickly incorporated digital marketing services to bring true growth to our clients.

In 2018, we decided to partner with HubSpot, the most powerful marketing, sales, and customer service platform. After much research, we reckoned that they had the tools to help our clients “Grow Better.” For us, it was a game-changing decision; not only did HubSpot help us create comprehensive growth solutions but it also turned My Creative Mark into a growth solutions agency!

Our values

RevenueZen works deeply across sales and marketing teams, using the power of organic across your website and your executive LinkedIn profiles to drive brand awareness that results in more trusted inbound leads every month.
We believe that inbound marketing campaigns produce valueable brand assets that you owe it to yourself to build up over time, yielding steady streams of leads for you to close. We operate at the intersection of:
Powerful forward-looking SEO
High-quality content that both your readers and Google will love
Compelling executive thought leadership on Linkedin
Outbound lead generation and distribution techniques that your average content marketers or SEO consultant has never learned about
Having led growth marketing, SEO, content, and sales development teams for 200+ companies, we work with our clients as fractional revenue advisors and leaders, not as order-takers.
If you want an agency to nod their heads and take your orders, then that's not us. If you'd prefer to get pushback on your ideas and work with people who stand firm on what they believe will work best for you, then we look forward to contributing to your 2022 growth and lead generation strategy.

Our engagements are the furthest from Cookie Cutter as we understand that each client has a unique set of goals and challenges. So, to address this we ensure that each relationship is built to ensure that the goals are met, and challenges overcome.

We believe that SEO is not some mythical creature or some sort of pandora s box. Our 100% white approach to SEO removes any Smoke and Mirrors or Secret sauce. We pull back the vail and let our client know and understand how we do business.

At CadenceSEO we strive to be easy to work with and remove any hurdles that some of our clients have voiced their concerns about. For that reason, we decided that we were not going to require any sort of long-term contracts, our services are essentially month to month. No long legal documents, no need for red tape, just plain and simple business arrangements.

If you are looking to hands off your SEO to a company and never talk to them, you have come to the WRONG place. We believe that communication is key to every successful SEO campaign. For that reason, we require that our clients talk to us at the least every other week but in the beginning we prefer to meet weekly to ensure that we can learn about your company and figure out how we are to fit in. Plus, we love to be in know about what else is going on so we can enhance the efforts with SEO.

Lastly, we are no slouches with it comes to SEO. You will be in contact with someone who is extraordinarily knowledgeable when it comes to SEO. No junior account managers that must ask the team or submit a ticket. The person managing your account should be able to get you answer on the spot. If not, they will quickly get back (oh and you won’t be billed for questions)!

Without traffic, you don’t have anyone visiting your website to convert into buyers. A recent study by Forrester Research discovered that OVER 80% of all search engine traffic comes from the top 10 listings (first page).

What does this mean to you? To put it bluntly, if you do not rank well for your niche keywords, you will receive little to no traffic, and your chances of success are slim to none.

Search engine optimization is one of the best ways to create targeted traffic for your website. There are many ways to generate traffic, but often times the visitors are not targeted, and thus end up viewing your site but not converting to customers. For this very reason, it is extremely important to create targeted traffic for your website.

With our SEO service, your website’s pages will attract visitors who are searching on specific keywords and keyword phrases. This is what targeted traffic means – getting potential customers to view your website that are actively looking for your product or service.

Right now your competitors are raking in the visitors for keyword phrases that apply to your company’s products and services. The reality is, most of your competitors have likely implemented an SEO campaign, and are profiting because of it.

We have over 10 years of SEO experience, and know what it takes to reach the first page of Google. If you give us the opportunity to earn your business, you too can get your share of those visitors from throughout the Central Valley.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/logo-200x200_5.png"},{"description":"Digitalux was founded with one goal – help business navigate the often confusing world of digital marketing.

Prolifik was founded over burritos and beers.
This is not to say that Prolifik's team members are any less qualified to provide you with brilliant design, compelling content or proven SEO strategies. Our firm's principals each have well over a decade of experience in their given fields and the tract record and portfolios to prove it. But way back when we met over those burritos and beers to discuss the real differentiating factors that would forge this venture, the work product and client results kept resurfacing as themes of our discussion.

These are our four primary areas of mastery supplemented by our team of experts who provide all supporting services. 
1.0 Integrated Digital Strategy: No single aspect of marketing operates in isolation. It s all connected. UX impacts SEO, PPC impacts Social Media, and Content Marketing is an essential component of Link Building. We design strategies with force multipliers to ensure that success from one tactic results in substantial increases in the success of another. 
2.0 Technical SEO: Modern SEO is about much more than keywords and headings. To compete at the highest level, you must stay a step ahead of everyone else...our team is several steps ahead. Our results speak for itself and our approach shapes the industry.  
3.0 Social Media Marketing: While others see Social Media as a popularity contest, we get down to business. We're goal-obsessed and use organic and paid social marketing to build brand awareness, generate traffic and leads, and, most importantly, drive sales.
4.0 User Experience (UX): UX is more than a service, it is a way of operating that puts your customer at the center of your design process to build objective-driven websites that convert. While many web development agencies "shoot from the hip," we don't write one line of code before researching and designing the entire experience. Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/ftf-logomark_fluxgreen.jpg"},{"description":"MetaSense Marketing is a Full-Service Digital Marketing Agency that takes pride in creating Successful, Comprehensive Marketing Plans and is the only company in the world to offer the patented AI Powered  iMetaDex™ tool.

Business owners and marketing executives wanting to achieve more from their business-to-business (B2B) marketing efforts rely on Innovaxis to create customized marketing programs that increase demand, leads and sales – starting with a marketing audit.

 

Your customized marketing program starts with development of a marketing strategy that identifies the right combination of inbound and outbound marketing to achieve your sales and marketing goals over the next 1-3+ years. This effort typically starts a marketing audit, possibly combined with market research, and leads to creation of a strategic marketing plan.

 

Execution of your strategic marketing plan consists of both digital and content marketing. Thought leadership content is developed (blogs, case studies, eguides, etc.) and spread by enhancing and leveraging your website, digital marketing campaigns (email, PPC), and marketing automation (Innovaxis is a HubSpot and Zoho partner). Your customized marketing program will also help you get the most out of traditional (non-digital) marketing efforts, including advertising, PR, direct mail, tradeshows, and may also include product management, channel marketing, and value-based pricing support.

 

Innovaxis marketing programs typically pay for themselves in the first 9-18 months, generating an ROI over 300% in the first 2-3 years by aligning your sales and marketing teams, increasing demand generation, and converting more leads into sales.

 

Are you a good fit for a customized marketing program from Innovaxis? If you see value in taking a strategic and holistic B2B marketing approach, understand that marketing results come from an open and collaborative effort, and value working with a strategic partner instead of a vendor – then let’s talk.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/aaeaaqaaaaaaaahlaaaajgi2yza5mwnhlwfiotitngi2ys05owvklwq3mjk3mja3zmuyoa.png"},{"description":"Location3 is the preferred digital partner franchise brands.

We make the magic happen by focusing on improving your website s conversion rates and overall revenue metrics, not just  rankings"​ or empty pageviews.

We believe small and technically elite teams can design and execute upon complex digital marketing strategies in a better, faster and more purposeful way while being more flexible and agile to perform advanced SEO strategies than do most bigger firms, which is why we keep our staff lean and only take on a handful of select clients at a time so that we can be completely dedicated to each client to properly fulfill each search marketing campaign.

*We’re obsessed with client revenues and we are ridiculously fulfillment focused (probably why we don’t have any outside investors either).

Let’s put it like this, 95% of our clients have been with us since our original inception --  on a month-to-month basis, without the need for a long and drawn-out contract to ensure we hit our deliverables.

We pride ourselve on our self-starting work ethic! We're blue collar by nature, our hard work ensures we earn our fees month in and month out, no questions asked.

Between us, our team has 35 years of experience in the online marketing industry, and we have no junior staff. Rarely, for some specific and highly complicated SEO problems, we may tap into our network of industry-leading specialists in different areas of search engine marketing — for an extra set of eyes, or to consult upon certain technical details but nonetheless, this is our core wolfpack.

And while you ve probably heard of some of those businesses, we lead with the names that matter most. Here’s what our clients say they like about working with us.
 
- Our technical approach to SEO, from the underground up, (did you know your website has an underbelly?). We inspect near-invisible - yet vital - site elements that no developer or standard SEO wants to go near. Building you that digital skyscraper requires a formidable foundation, so we start there.
 
- Clear communication. We value you enough to ask tough questions and welcome them right back. Challenging conventional thinking, even our own previously successful ideas is how we reach new heights.
 
- No contracts. No handcuffs. We’re not here to take the easy path, make a quick buck, get a fast score. We believe in making our clients happy by delivering great work, not by locking them up. This is not your mobile phone service. :)
 
- Immense toolshed. No kidding, WP Suites understands and expertly handles the well-known tools (SEMRush, Ahrefs, SpyFu, etc.) at deep levels. What's more impressive are the lesser-known and brand new tools we purchase and apply to achieve awesome campaign results.
 
- Transparency, like looking through a brand new window. In fact, we’re glad to teach you what we’re doing, if you want. We believe that by so empowering you we can accomplish far more together. Of course, we are also happy to do all the work, while you take the glory for the success.

What Makes us Unique?

An investment in your marketing campaign is an investment in your future. It is risky to not invest, while over investing can prove to be just as risky. We help you make the right decisions and feel confident in your choices by identifying key performance indicators (KPI’s) and by implementing direct marketing techniques, which are trackable and measurable due to the fact that they require a direct response. Being able to directly track prospects provides a concise ROI and allows for you to get a clearer picture of your return on marketing investment (ROMI).

Ideally, successful online marketing campaigns are now known to integrate a number of different elements including video marketing, mobile search, email marketing, SEO, organic search to mention but a few.

We work to make the entire marketing process as simple, or as complicated, as you would like. You can be involved with as much, or as little, as you wish. Outsource all of your marketing needs to our team or, if preferred, hire us to work alongside you or your team. When it comes to implementing successful marketing campaigns, there is no one-size fits all solution.

At Strategic e-Marketing, we develop marketing strategies that are relevant by catering to your business’s exact needs.

My Name is Will Palmer, and I ll show your law firm how to acquire more new clients with a data-driven and proven SEO strategy.
Now-a-days, most SEO services are a complete waste of money and aren’t helping grow your law firm.
My team knows every trick in the book.
For years I worked for a marketing company that offered SEO services that rarely, if ever, worked well. The services were these “canned” one-size-fits-all subscriptions added onto websites that were offered to every business regardless of practice area, location, and market.
I couldn’t bring myself to sell the stuff.
What I learned in my own discovery process is that most SEO companies exploit the fact you’re not an SEO expert, but they know you understand it’s important to rank high in search.
Now ask yourself…
Does your current law firm SEO company effectively get your law firm website in front of more new potential clients searching for your practice area(s)?
What are you actually paying your SEO service provider to do every month?
Is any of it working?
Most law firms I speak to have no clue what, if anything, is truly working and are forced to blindly trust that they’re paying for an SEO service that’s doing its job. 
Unfortunately, a lot of SEO services are worthless and provide little real value.
For this reason, it has become my personal mission to recommend the top SEO services that produce REAL RESULTS and do so with total transparency. 
Real results do not mean a fancy monthly report in your email. 
Real SEO results = increased case acquisition rate.
Real SEO results = increased monthly signed cases.
Real SEO results = beating your competitors and owning the majority of market share.

Instaboost Media is a family first and a business second. Every team member is given resources not only to help customers to improve their own skills.

What’s the value of Digital Marketing? Simple. Digital Marketing can give you real trackable growth. That means you can measure exactly how many leads or sales your marketing budget earned.

Digital Marketing can.

Our mission: to become your favorite marketing peeps, ever.
What we do best: branding, content strategy and creation, digital campaigns, and marketing operations (HubSpot, Klaviyo, Mailchimp etc.)
How we re different:
We’re not really agency people. We come from a long line of in-house roles -- ranging from startups to brands like IBM, Oracle, Keds, and JanSport. Long story short: We've been on your side of the table and on your end of the phone. We’ve fallen hard for an agency and ate a ton of ice cream when it was time to break up. And that's why we're here.
What makes us stand out?
We have max of four clients at a time and we stick to it.
We don’t have new business people. We focus on the clients we have vs. bringing in more.
Interns won’t lead your account.
If you work with us, you’ll be a big fish in a small pond, with a tight-knit team (not an army) of all-senior folks who truly care about your success. Our team won’t dare do the same thing as your competitors. In fact, we pride ourselves on proposing the outlandish, but it’s a matter of finding a forward-thinking renegade like you, to say yes.

A Team-Based Approach
Our subject matter experts work together seamlessly to provide you with comprehensive marketing at a fraction of the cost of hiring internally or using multiple different vendors. Our team works to free up your CMO, allowing them to be the quarterback while we get busy running the plays.

A Proven, Unique Process
The holes in your marketing are costing you more than you know. That’s why we start with a Gap Assessment to identify critical opportunities and provide you with a 3-5 year roadmap to 5 to 10x your sales opportunities. Then we get to work implementing our unique process, which is a systematic approach to inbound marketing that has a proven track record that we’re proud to stand behind.

Data-Driven Analytics
Do you have a firm grasp on your analytics? Are you prepared to make data driven decisions? If you aren’t able to prove the ROI from your marketing efforts with solid analytics, then you probably need to partner with a new agency. Don’t waste any more time doing the same thing and expecting different results.

When we say branding and brand image, it isn’t just about a cool logo, or even one particular visual or some banners. It’s about a whole story of how the brand makes its space in the client’s heart and mind. It needs to be something that stirs up the whole scenario. It constitutes a set of features and characteristics that the clients associates to the product you’re offering. Now how impressive are those characteristics is what decides your brand equity.

My name is Brenan Gale and I am the founder and CEO of Utah Digital Marketing Experts, Utah's best and most experienced digital marketing company.You're probaly asking yourself,  What makes you the best?".That's a good question, and it ultimately comes down to four reasons: #1 We have more experience delivering results to Utah businesses (in every industry) than any other company. In 2009, my business partner and I founded Be Locally SEO, and over the next decade, we became Utah's #1 SEO firm for Utah businesses. We were well-known for actually following through, and getting our customers the results they were paying us for. In 2018, we sold Be Locally SEO to our largest competitor. #2 Not only are we the most experienced, but we also follow through on a proven strategy and the work to achieve great results for our customers. We never cut corners, and we always focus on quality. This mindset is what seperates us from all the other "set and forget" digital marketing companies. #3 You receive personalized attention! While many of the larger companies say they're going to do SEO fo you, we find that they actually do very little, and you rarely hear from them. On the contrary, we follow through for our customers every time, and stay in close contact as your go-to digital marketing team. We also provide monthly progress reporting so you can see first hand the fruits of our labor that you pay for. #4 We have no long-term commitments! We create long-term relationships with our customer through results, not contracts. We either keep you as a happy customer, or we lose you forever. For these reasons, I ask that you give us a chance to prove it. We'll make every invested penny be well worth the money, and I promise you wont be disappointed!Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/838f8935fedcb8222304bcd35f8b7cd8.png"},{"description":"Over our the years in the online marketing industry, we’ve built up a range of technological tools that help us help you more effectively.

For those of you who are new to SEO, Search engine optimization is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine’s unpaid (organic) search results.
The higher a page is ranked in search results and/or the more frequently a site appears in the search results list the more visitors it will receive.
I don’t like to brag, but I want you to feel comfortable working with my team and me.
Here’s a little bit of what One SEO has accomplished over the years:
We’ve worked on countless SEO projects where we have audited websites, determined the best keywords to focus on, built backlinks, and helped websites rank on the FIRST page of search engines organically.
Our SEO work has resulted in millions of fresh organic searches for our customers and our own sites.
We’ve built white-hat backlinks on thousands of websites and can continue to build thousands more, with no PBNs, black hat or spam links, comments, forums, or scraped sites.
Our strategy consists of assessing blogs based on their relevancy, sites Domain Authority, MozRank, Alexa rank, readership, followers, or any other criteria that the client finds relevant.
Our goal for One SEO is to help as many ambitious entrepreneurs as possible expand their businesses through Search Engine Optimization.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/33cb40fe1694bf5154605e20d53194a1.jpeg"},{"description":"Primelis is a top international digital marketing agency.

Our Story
We started in 2009 when we were hired to develop a worldwide marketing program for a client who created a money management software program. So while we put together a team of professional marketers, got advice from various marketing “gurus”, and put in our 10,000 hours of study of the subject, we successfully launched a marketing program for the client.
This client sold the software to small business owners throughout the world. These business owners liked the software because it helped them manage their cash flow. But when surveyed, they stated that they wanted more people to find them online, so they could get more customers.
So we used our marketing expertise and our team to provide online marketing services to these business owners. They were happy, they gave us referrals, those referrals gave us more referrals, and we continue to grow each year helping clients like yourselves.
Customer Finder continues to grow and help more clients because we treat all our clients in this way:
Ø  Transparency - Show them what we do in a transparent way – they can monitor us every step of the way from the reports we give them showing their results.
Ø  Education - Show them the exact steps and tasks we do when we perform their marketing tasks.
Ø  Results - Show them their marketing results on a weekly and monthly basis and give them access to their own dashboard as long as they are a client.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/bf0a31bc39d20f200623748c33e8660f.png"},{"description":"Since 2009, our SEO agency has grown into a leading search engine optimization consulting and training company and we’re proud to have been named a “Top 20 Denver SEO Company”.

So ask yourself this. Why then are attorney SEO providers still using the same stale tactics from a decade ago? That s what we were wondering as well.
In the lawyer SEO space, one has to be cutting edge, modern in fact. One has to understand the reward mechanisms that the Google algorithm relies on while providing the highest quality and highest level of service to their clients.
Intricate knowledge is what we pride ourselves on. Understanding how the algorithm works better than any other firm in the SEO for lawyers space, that's what we do.
Relying on experience, continued testing and our knowledge of how Google's machine learning works we bring the best of search engine optimization for our clients.
Focusing on more modern approaches to SEO has allowed us to separate ourselves from the pack when it comes to getting results in an efficient manner. In fact, effectiveness and efficiency are the byproduct of the work we've done to understand exactly what Google wants from your law firm's website when it comes to getting rewarded in the SERPS.
Rewards are what we seek for our clients. We understand that you work hard on your craft. Whether studying previous judgements, holding moot court or a mock trial we understand that law is your craft. 
SEO is our craft. It's not as simple as it once was, in fact it's more complicated than ever but once you understand how the pieces fit together, it's quite easy. Now while that may sound like a contradictory statement, please understand that SEO has evolved dramatically over the last decade and we've been here to watch and study it the entire time.
That's what separates us from the rest of the law firm SEO companies out there. We're more knowledgeable than any other company in this space. We understand what it takes to get the results you need in order to take your firm to the next level.

Some digital marketing agency  norms" you ll never see us adopting:
Using siloed strategies and teams
Starting with strong results but fizzling out over time
Focusing on acquiring new clients at the expense of existing clients
Struggling to retain and develop top talent marketers
Struggling to remain on the cutting edge of marketing advancements
Drowning in continual algorithm and platform updates
Lacking the visibility to execute effective strategies

Top Talent - We hire, develop, & retain top marketing talent so they can bring game-changing magic to our client’s accounts to help them reach their goals, make a positive impact on the world, and claim the leading edge in their industries!

You’ve never worked with an SEO partner like us. We help elite law firms & personal injury lawyers dominate first page rankings through search engine optimization. 

We can’t promise you that we’re the cheapest option available, but we can promise that no agency has a more experienced staff…or better results.

“The retainer I pay – without any hesitation – is the best ROI of any marketing dollar I spend. It’s the most cost effective way to get good, qualified cases.” ~ Stewart J. Guss, Attorney at Law

Delivering exceptional service and aggressive growth means limiting who we work with. Our clients are our partners: we implement quickly, communicate openly, and invest seriously to dominate the first page.

SEO is an investment; so is law school and studying for the bar. Many clients see a return on investment in as little as six months

When you’re thinking of hiring an SEO agency, you’re looking for who can produce results, execute at the highest level, and most importantly:

Deliver proof, not promises.

Our clients rank for keywords like:

“Houston Car Accident Lawyer” (Stewart J. Guss, Esq.)
	“Philadelphia Car Accident Lawyer” (Gabriel Levin, Esq.)
	“Chicago Car Accident Lawyer” (Dave Abels, Esq.)
We’ve even had a client rank on the first page nationwide for “car accident lawyer.”

The best in the industry trust us to deliver the rankings, traffic, and cases other firms can’t.

Accountability starts at the top. Most agencies hide behind excuses and jargon. They take your money, work hard for a month, then coast.

You deserve better; that’s why we exist.

We’re entrepreneurs helping entrepreneurs.

Back in 2008, the economic recession dealt crushing blows to small business owners everywhere.

Among those businesses affected were New Life Rockeries (owned and operated by Neil Eneix Sr.) Left with crippling debt and difficult choices, things seemed grim for the small landscaping business.

In an effort to help their family recover financially, his two oldest sons Keith and Neil Eneix began a small SEO company to help provide financial relief for the family.

Experiencing success through hard work, passion, and smarter marketing & sales systems Neil Eneix Sr was able to pull B&D Rockeries back into the green (no landscaping pun intended) and plant the seed that ultimately grew into our full-services marketing agency, Fannit! 

Our mission has stayed the same as it was back in 2008; we’re entrepreneurs helping entrepreneurs. With our deep experience in digital marketing, we help optimize sales and marketing machines so that companies reach new levels of growth!

We take an analytics-based approach to digital execution and are known for producing relevant brand experiences while also delivering the evidence to back up our successes. Our results-proven mix of cross-channel marketing, audience-centric creative, and data-backed strategies focused on engagement will present new opportunities well beyond the traditional days of impressions-driven programmatic and mass media buys.

 

HOW WE WORK

Most firms are virtual factories, where managers juggle dozens of accounts every day. This is a lose-lose situation. You re not happy in the end, and we don't have a relationship we're proud to stand by.

Each strategist is assigned a small handful of our account load, becoming an expert in every aspect of your business, and market movements. The work we do is labor-intensive, communication-intensive, and incredibly dynamic. Overloading our teams would make success impossible.

Preserving this service model requires us to be pragmatic in choosing client partners. We will objectively analyze your business, goals, and budget well before we negotiate terms. If we determine we can’t bring value to your or our methodology isn’t a good fit, we'll be honest. Consequently, should you choose us as your digital partner, you can be confident in our ability to deliver the results we promise.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/pbj.png"},{"description":"GUARANTEED RESULTS

Search is proven to be one of the highest converting media opportunities of possible marketing spends. Why? Because the advertising company captures the audience looking for the exact product or service at the exact moment they need it. They already have the sense of urgency built in. They need a phone number and a contact box to get a quote. What we do is put companies in front of the consumers by organic, paid and local search through Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (Pay Per Click Advertising) via Google AdWords & Bing Ads, Google Shopping, ReMarketing, Facebook Ads, and Google/Bing maps.

The search marketing industry is always evolving, and here at OptFirst we are always on top of our game. Most recently we have specialized in creating and optimizing AMP mobile sites. We build websites that not only look great but also perform, drive targeted actions and invite consumer interaction. Our sites have powerful tools that track, monitor, measure and test every visitor action and intention.

Once a consumer finds a company via search – they will also check their online reputation. 79% of consumers trust online reviews as much a personal recommendation so it’s very important to showcase your happy clients. When you seamlessly integrate all these aspects – the results are powerful. You have increased customers, sales and company growth.

****SEO****

You have worked hard to create a website full of valuable content, but you do not see the expected traffic or results. 

It s incredibly frustrating when you put so much effort into something and don't see the returns you were hoping for. You're not alone. Many businesses experience this same problem with their website.

That's where our game-changing SEO Supercharge service comes in. 

We’re so confident that we can help improve the visibility of your website that we have a 100% money-back guarantee. No one can guarantee a #1 ranking on Google. But after 20+ years of building and growing websites, we are willing to assume the risk and guarantee your results!

Recent examples from real clients - A 22,640% improvement (not a typo) in visibility. That's exceptionally high, we admit. But another client has seen an 1122% improvement. These are just 2 examples of many.

 

****WEBSITES****

This is where it all starts. The only digital property you actually own (no, you don't own your Instagram page...Meta does). Mess up your website, and it doesn't matter what else you do for SEO, ads, or social media because you will never maximize value (revenue) from that traffic.

Our website services are designed to be efficient, affordable, and thorough. Our approach keeps you in control of the project and what we're working on.

 

***Your Success Is Our Success*** 

Our formula is simple: 

You run your business + we run your website + we manage your digital identity = your business grows.

No wonder you feel stressed! You can’t afford a marketing fail–not when time and money are tight and so much is on the line.

At Aspire, we know the pressure of needing to attract a steady stream of new leads and customers. And we believe you shouldn’t be paying for marketing that doesn’t deliver. You deserve great ROI.

That’s why we took our decades of experience leading successful marketing campaigns for SMBs–and several Fortune 500 companies–and created Aspire Marketing Group. Our process for better ROI is simple:

1. Request a free marketing assessment. You’ll get some valuable tips, and we’ll tell you if we think we can help you. If so, and if you want to proceed…

2. Order a customized marketing plan. We’ll do a 6-8 week deep dive, resulting in a detailed roadmap for marketing success that comes with a money-back guarantee.

3. Invite us to execute your plan. Once we ve won your trust, hire us. You’ll get a “fractional marketing department” with all the marketing & RevOps skills your business needs.

You don’t have to settle for desperate marketing efforts that are generic and random. And you sure don’t have to stress over expensive marketing that doesn’t bring in revenue.

We work best with clients that are managing a watershed moment -- launching a new product, seeking funding, going through a branding shift, or implementing a new automation strategy. We specialize in media relations, online influence, and strategy.

What distinguishes us from other firms or agencies is our ability to scale and the large amount of business acumen we bring to our strategies. It’s not often you find PR people and writers who are also well-versed in running a successful business – knowing how to interpret success in the same way your board, investors and employees do is critical in making sure our activities tie back to your business goals.

Our team has hands-on experience growing their own businesses, so we understand exactly what you need and why it’s important. This innate business acumen sets us apart from other traditional agency teams.

We bring to bear the full services and expertise of a larger agency without all the overhead. There’s no bait-and-switch to a less experienced project manager.

Your team at Pietryla PR is senior-level and has years of experience getting stuff done. There is no way you will ever work with a person who either can’t or isn’t prepared to make a strategic decision. Our billing and reporting practices are transparent and are the same for all of our clients.

We help innovative businesses expand into new markets by leveraging digital strategies and technology.

Our story

Our story began as a 1-person graphic design agency but we quickly incorporated digital marketing services to bring true growth to our clients.

In 2018, we decided to partner with HubSpot, the most powerful marketing, sales, and customer service platform. After much research, we reckoned that they had the tools to help our clients “Grow Better.” For us, it was a game-changing decision; not only did HubSpot help us create comprehensive growth solutions but it also turned My Creative Mark into a growth solutions agency!

What is a growth solutions agency?

As a growth solutions agency, My Creative Mark uses a mix of digital strategies and technology that attract, convert, and retain customers to bring big results for our clients.

Our mission

Our mission is to help innovative businesses expand into new markets. And we’ve been highly successful at this!

Not to brag, but we’ve achieved HubSpot’s Platinum status in 2022, we rank among the top 10 Digital Marketing Agencies according to DesignRush and we’ve helped companies in over 10 countries worldwide reach their full potential.

Our values

Transparency: We don’t only include customers in our project management portal. We let them into our world to take a closer look at what goes into their success.

Agility: In today’s world priorities and goals can change in an instant, this is why we’re always seeking new ways to evolve and perfect our craft. In turn, this allows us to quickly shift gears and pivot so that we can always be on top of our customer’s needs and be as agile as they need to be.

Empowerment: We empower customers through extensive onboarding and training, in other words, it’s a watch-and-learn process. We invite you in but don’t leave you empty-handed, giving you and your team the knowledge, tools, and resources to succeed.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/a18e6c39333ed8b94ae4b4ac4bad0d34.svg"},{"description":"RMC has innovated new strategies and techniques that repair existing damages, clear your reputation, and safeguards against new attacks, all while doubling as an effective online PR campaign.

Powerful forward-looking SEO
High-quality content that both your readers and Google will love

Our engagements are the furthest from Cookie Cutter as we understand that each client has a unique set of goals and challenges. So, to address this we ensure that each relationship is built to ensure that the goals are met, and challenges overcome.

We believe that SEO is not some mythical creature or some sort of pandora s box. Our 100% white approach to SEO removes any Smoke and Mirrors or Secret sauce. We pull back the vail and let our client know and understand how we do business.

At CadenceSEO we strive to be easy to work with and remove any hurdles that some of our clients have voiced their concerns about. For that reason, we decided that we were not going to require any sort of long-term contracts, our services are essentially month to month. No long legal documents, no need for red tape, just plain and simple business arrangements.

If you are looking to hands off your SEO to a company and never talk to them, you have come to the WRONG place. We believe that communication is key to every successful SEO campaign. For that reason, we require that our clients talk to us at the least every other week but in the beginning we prefer to meet weekly to ensure that we can learn about your company and figure out how we are to fit in. Plus, we love to be in know about what else is going on so we can enhance the efforts with SEO.

Lastly, we are no slouches with it comes to SEO. You will be in contact with someone who is extraordinarily knowledgeable when it comes to SEO. No junior account managers that must ask the team or submit a ticket. The person managing your account should be able to get you answer on the spot. If not, they will quickly get back (oh and you won’t be billed for questions)!

As he saw it,  most websites are toads, our goal is to make them nimble."

Without traffic, you don’t have anyone visiting your website to convert into buyers. A recent study by Forrester Research discovered that OVER 80% of all search engine traffic comes from the top 10 listings (first page).

What does this mean to you? To put it bluntly, if you do not rank well for your niche keywords, you will receive little to no traffic, and your chances of success are slim to none.

Search engine optimization is one of the best ways to create targeted traffic for your website. There are many ways to generate traffic, but often times the visitors are not targeted, and thus end up viewing your site but not converting to customers. For this very reason, it is extremely important to create targeted traffic for your website.

With our SEO service, your website’s pages will attract visitors who are searching on specific keywords and keyword phrases. This is what targeted traffic means – getting potential customers to view your website that are actively looking for your product or service.

Right now your competitors are raking in the visitors for keyword phrases that apply to your company’s products and services. The reality is, most of your competitors have likely implemented an SEO campaign, and are profiting because of it.

We have over 10 years of SEO experience, and know what it takes to reach the first page of Google. If you give us the opportunity to earn your business, you too can get your share of those visitors from throughout the Central Valley.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/logo-200x200_5.png"},{"description":"Digitalux was founded with one goal – help business navigate the often confusing world of digital marketing.

Business owners and marketing executives wanting to achieve more from their business-to-business (B2B) marketing efforts rely on Innovaxis to create customized marketing programs that increase demand, leads and sales – starting with a marketing audit.

 

Your customized marketing program starts with development of a marketing strategy that identifies the right combination of inbound and outbound marketing to achieve your sales and marketing goals over the next 1-3+ years. This effort typically starts a marketing audit, possibly combined with market research, and leads to creation of a strategic marketing plan.

 

Execution of your strategic marketing plan consists of both digital and content marketing. Thought leadership content is developed (blogs, case studies, eguides, etc.) and spread by enhancing and leveraging your website, digital marketing campaigns (email, PPC), and marketing automation (Innovaxis is a HubSpot and Zoho partner). Your customized marketing program will also help you get the most out of traditional (non-digital) marketing efforts, including advertising, PR, direct mail, tradeshows, and may also include product management, channel marketing, and value-based pricing support.

 

Innovaxis marketing programs typically pay for themselves in the first 9-18 months, generating an ROI over 300% in the first 2-3 years by aligning your sales and marketing teams, increasing demand generation, and converting more leads into sales.

 

Are you a good fit for a customized marketing program from Innovaxis? If you see value in taking a strategic and holistic B2B marketing approach, understand that marketing results come from an open and collaborative effort, and value working with a strategic partner instead of a vendor – then let’s talk.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/aaeaaqaaaaaaaahlaaaajgi2yza5mwnhlwfiotitngi2ys05owvklwq3mjk3mja3zmuyoa.png"},{"description":"Location3 is the preferred digital partner franchise brands.

And while you ve probably heard of some of those businesses, we lead with the names that matter most. Here’s what our clients say they like about working with us.
 
- Our technical approach to SEO, from the underground up, (did you know your website has an underbelly?). We inspect near-invisible - yet vital - site elements that no developer or standard SEO wants to go near. Building you that digital skyscraper requires a formidable foundation, so we start there.
 
- Clear communication. We value you enough to ask tough questions and welcome them right back. Challenging conventional thinking, even our own previously successful ideas is how we reach new heights.
 
- No contracts. No handcuffs. We’re not here to take the easy path, make a quick buck, get a fast score. We believe in making our clients happy by delivering great work, not by locking them up. This is not your mobile phone service. :)
 
- Immense toolshed. No kidding, WP Suites understands and expertly handles the well-known tools (SEMRush, Ahrefs, SpyFu, etc.) at deep levels. What's more impressive are the lesser-known and brand new tools we purchase and apply to achieve awesome campaign results.
 
- Transparency, like looking through a brand new window. In fact, we’re glad to teach you what we’re doing, if you want. We believe that by so empowering you we can accomplish far more together. Of course, we are also happy to do all the work, while you take the glory for the success.

If they do, they are either scamming you or intending to employ black-hat tactics, which will demolish your future site rankings. Regardless of what you may have been told or read, it takes months to achieve and/or restore top organic rankings and increase conversions.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/bbbf0c6173204a9d3b090f69ee207a73.png"},{"description":"Hero Creative is a place where they keep on pushing until each day is better than the last.

What Makes us Unique?

An investment in your marketing campaign is an investment in your future. It is risky to not invest, while over investing can prove to be just as risky. We help you make the right decisions and feel confident in your choices by identifying key performance indicators (KPI’s) and by implementing direct marketing techniques, which are trackable and measurable due to the fact that they require a direct response. Being able to directly track prospects provides a concise ROI and allows for you to get a clearer picture of your return on marketing investment (ROMI).

Ideally, successful online marketing campaigns are now known to integrate a number of different elements including video marketing, mobile search, email marketing, SEO, organic search to mention but a few.

We work to make the entire marketing process as simple, or as complicated, as you would like. You can be involved with as much, or as little, as you wish. Outsource all of your marketing needs to our team or, if preferred, hire us to work alongside you or your team. When it comes to implementing successful marketing campaigns, there is no one-size fits all solution.

At Strategic e-Marketing, we develop marketing strategies that are relevant by catering to your business’s exact needs. Through analyzing your website, current marketing efforts, industry, consumers, target markets and competition, we identify the e-marketing strategies that will help sell your products or services.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/950c9e7637a598263d0c977047922d20.jpg"},{"description":"NB Media Solutions, LLC is a Certified Wix.com Partnered agency based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

My Name is Will Palmer, and I ll show your law firm how to acquire more new clients with a data-driven and proven SEO strategy.
Now-a-days, most SEO services are a complete waste of money and aren’t helping grow your law firm.
My team knows every trick in the book.
For years I worked for a marketing company that offered SEO services that rarely, if ever, worked well. The services were these “canned” one-size-fits-all subscriptions added onto websites that were offered to every business regardless of practice area, location, and market.
I couldn’t bring myself to sell the stuff.
What I learned in my own discovery process is that most SEO companies exploit the fact you’re not an SEO expert, but they know you understand it’s important to rank high in search.
Now ask yourself…
Does your current law firm SEO company effectively get your law firm website in front of more new potential clients searching for your practice area(s)?
What are you actually paying your SEO service provider to do every month?
Is any of it working?
Most law firms I speak to have no clue what, if anything, is truly working and are forced to blindly trust that they’re paying for an SEO service that’s doing its job. 
Unfortunately, a lot of SEO services are worthless and provide little real value.
For this reason, it has become my personal mission to recommend the top SEO services that produce REAL RESULTS and do so with total transparency. 
Real results do not mean a fancy monthly report in your email. 
Real SEO results = increased case acquisition rate.
Real SEO results = increased monthly signed cases.
Real SEO results = beating your competitors and owning the majority of market share.

What’s the value of Digital Marketing? Simple. Digital Marketing can give you real trackable growth. That means you can measure exactly how many leads or sales your marketing budget earned. No mysteries. Just hard numbers. Traditional marketing services like billboards, print ads, TV, radio, and direct mail can increase the awareness of your business, but they usually can’t tell you exactly how many leads or sales were generated from the dollars you spent.

With services like Email Marketing, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (SEM), Content Marketing, and Social Media Marketing we can help you get real trackable results.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/a106ae9ae5fcd574d2937c24ee46819a.jpeg"},{"description":"We started Lyft after building sites and performing SEO services for our own companies.

How we re different:
We’re not really agency people. We come from a long line of in-house roles -- ranging from startups to brands like IBM, Oracle, Keds, and JanSport. Long story short: We've been on your side of the table and on your end of the phone. We’ve fallen hard for an agency and ate a ton of ice cream when it was time to break up. And that's why we're here.
What makes us stand out?
We have max of four clients at a time and we stick to it.
We don’t have new business people. We focus on the clients we have vs. bringing in more.
Interns won’t lead your account.
If you work with us, you’ll be a big fish in a small pond, with a tight-knit team (not an army) of all-senior folks who truly care about your success.

What makes us different?
A Team-Based Approach
Our subject matter experts work together seamlessly to provide you with comprehensive marketing at a fraction of the cost of hiring internally or using multiple different vendors. Our team works to free up your CMO, allowing them to be the quarterback while we get busy running the plays.

A Proven, Unique Process
The holes in your marketing are costing you more than you know. That’s why we start with a Gap Assessment to identify critical opportunities and provide you with a 3-5 year roadmap to 5 to 10x your sales opportunities. Then we get to work implementing our unique process, which is a systematic approach to inbound marketing that has a proven track record that we’re proud to stand behind.

Data-Driven Analytics
Do you have a firm grasp on your analytics? Are you prepared to make data driven decisions? If you aren’t able to prove the ROI from your marketing efforts with solid analytics, then you probably need to partner with a new agency. Don’t waste any more time doing the same thing and expecting different results.

My name is Brenan Gale and I am the founder and CEO of Utah Digital Marketing Experts, Utah's best and most experienced digital marketing company.You're probaly asking yourself,  What makes you the best?".That's a good question, and it ultimately comes down to four reasons: #1 We have more experience delivering results to Utah businesses (in every industry) than any other company. In 2009, my business partner and I founded Be Locally SEO, and over the next decade, we became Utah's #1 SEO firm for Utah businesses. We were well-known for actually following through, and getting our customers the results they were paying us for. In 2018, we sold Be Locally SEO to our largest competitor. #2 Not only are we the most experienced, but we also follow through on a proven strategy and the work to achieve great results for our customers. We never cut corners, and we always focus on quality. This mindset is what seperates us from all the other "set and forget" digital marketing companies. #3 You receive personalized attention! While many of the larger companies say they're going to do SEO fo you, we find that they actually do very little, and you rarely hear from them. On the contrary, we follow through for our customers every time, and stay in close contact as your go-to digital marketing team. We also provide monthly progress reporting so you can see first hand the fruits of our labor that you pay for. #4 We have no long-term commitments! We create long-term relationships with our customer through results, not contracts. We either keep you as a happy customer, or we lose you forever. For these reasons, I ask that you give us a chance to prove it. We'll make every invested penny be well worth the money, and I promise you wont be disappointed!Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/838f8935fedcb8222304bcd35f8b7cd8.png"},{"description":"Over our the years in the online marketing industry, we’ve built up a range of technological tools that help us help you more effectively.

Considering our clients stick around 4 times longer than the industry average, putting clients first is the recipe that makes us successful.
Our Story
We started in 2009 when we were hired to develop a worldwide marketing program for a client who created a money management software program. So while we put together a team of professional marketers, got advice from various marketing “gurus”, and put in our 10,000 hours of study of the subject, we successfully launched a marketing program for the client.
This client sold the software to small business owners throughout the world. These business owners liked the software because it helped them manage their cash flow. But when surveyed, they stated that they wanted more people to find them online, so they could get more customers.
So we used our marketing expertise and our team to provide online marketing services to these business owners. They were happy, they gave us referrals, those referrals gave us more referrals, and we continue to grow each year helping clients like yourselves.
Customer Finder continues to grow and help more clients because we treat all our clients in this way:
Ø  Transparency - Show them what we do in a transparent way – they can monitor us every step of the way from the reports we give them showing their results.
Ø  Education - Show them the exact steps and tasks we do when we perform their marketing tasks.
Ø  Results - Show them their marketing results on a weekly and monthly basis and give them access to their own dashboard as long as they are a client.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/bf0a31bc39d20f200623748c33e8660f.png"},{"description":"Since 2009, our SEO agency has grown into a leading search engine optimization consulting and training company and we’re proud to have been named a “Top 20 Denver SEO Company”.

So ask yourself this. Why then are attorney SEO providers still using the same stale tactics from a decade ago? That s what we were wondering as well.
In the lawyer SEO space, one has to be cutting edge, modern in fact. One has to understand the reward mechanisms that the Google algorithm relies on while providing the highest quality and highest level of service to their clients.
Intricate knowledge is what we pride ourselves on. Understanding how the algorithm works better than any other firm in the SEO for lawyers space, that's what we do.
Relying on experience, continued testing and our knowledge of how Google's machine learning works we bring the best of search engine optimization for our clients.
Focusing on more modern approaches to SEO has allowed us to separate ourselves from the pack when it comes to getting results in an efficient manner. In fact, effectiveness and efficiency are the byproduct of the work we've done to understand exactly what Google wants from your law firm's website when it comes to getting rewarded in the SERPS.
Rewards are what we seek for our clients. We understand that you work hard on your craft. Whether studying previous judgements, holding moot court or a mock trial we understand that law is your craft. 
SEO is our craft. It's not as simple as it once was, in fact it's more complicated than ever but once you understand how the pieces fit together, it's quite easy. Now while that may sound like a contradictory statement, please understand that SEO has evolved dramatically over the last decade and we've been here to watch and study it the entire time.
That's what separates us from the rest of the law firm SEO companies out there. We're more knowledgeable than any other company in this space. We understand what it takes to get the results you need in order to take your firm to the next level.

That s where we step in. Specifically for commercial and industrial contractors with stagnant growth:  Quantum Audience Targeting  Developed by Drexel software engineers and paired with Marketo automation. The most effective way to educate your ideal clients on your services and close your most coveted accounts in the next 6 months. It’s true… There’s a new and different way for you perform outbound sales at the industrial level. It’s called Quantum Audience Targeting. It’s very different from the common outbound sales methods you’re likely familiar with because you only target your ideal customers or companies who are currently in buying cycles and NEED your services NOW. Most companies have buying cycles. For example, a 30 year old building may be due for an energy efficiency upgrade on all systems. Quantum Audience Targeting is how you find them. And as you’ll see, while we do all the heavy lifting on the back end with robust software and measuring tools. Once your ICP reaches a “significant level of interest”, we alert your sales team in real time, allowing you to open up a conversation about the right thing, at the right time. And since we’re hyper-focusing on specific accounts, conversions happen faster - you could close your next $1M project in as little as 60 days from launch. Best part is it doesn’t require you to guess how to acquire more market share - we use data to show buying intent. That way you re only relying on your sales team to close accounts, and not find new accounts or project opportunities. And you will close more project opportunities even faster as the campaign progresses, regardless of whether or not you’ve ever invested in marketing before, or if the accounts your targeting already have a relationship with another vendor. So, if you want to close up to 5 new contracts with your sought-after multi-million dollar accounts within the next 6 months, please contact us!Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/5cd48346706e31f29722e29aba1b631c.png"},{"description":"Clicks Digital Marketing is a full-service digital marketing agency and Atlanta based SEO firm that specializes in helping businesses acquire a competitive advantage, a larger customer base, improved click rate, and long-term growth regardless of technological changes.

We are exclusive to:

The inbound marketing philosophy
	B2B clients
	HubSpot CRM
We believe marketing is about influencing people, and relationships are the currency of your influence. When you produce quality content on a regular basis, you attract more leads and followers. When you educate your prospects and eliminate friction in the buying process, you ll close more deals. And when you listen to your customers and keep them engaged, they ll stick around longer, buy more and spread the word.

We believe paid advertising campaigns should be supplemental projects to core marketing and growth initiatives. Advertising is renting exposure on someone else s platform for short periods of time at ever-increasing costs. Becoming overly-reliant on this depreciating, pay-for-play cycle is a marketing poverty trap.

We believe growth is part of the operating system, not something you do when you feel like it. Building the assets you own or control creates inertia that propels scalable, organic growth. You rank higher on search engines and get more website traffic. Your email list grows. You gain more followers on social media. As these platforms grow they appreciate in value over time. And since you own them, your baseline marketing capacity scales. It s the ultimate get rich slow scheme.

Common services include:

Inbound marketing strategy
	Web design and development
	Content strategy and production
	HubSpot onboarding and maintenance
	Lead generation
	Email marketing and lead nurturing
	Marketing automation
	Sales enablement
	Customer feedback and engagement

Outside-The-Box Thinking

The Internet has plenty of scams and ways to waste your marketing dollars. We believe your marketing strategy should remain focused on results. We provide expert level insights into today’s trends but also know what actually works and how to implement it. We’ll be your digital marketing sherpas.

Industry Leading Analytics

We only trust data that is straight from the source to build custom reporting for your company. We rely as little as possible on dashboards and other API solutions that are easily broken and hard to fix, instead of making sure the data is verifiable and accurate. This diligence allows you to have confidence in your numbers.

Transparency In Results

We deploy state-of-the-art technology to build a cohesive lead attribution system, showing you exactly how your campaigns are performing, in real-time. All phone calls, forms and other conversions are counted and attributed according to the strategy we agree on. This allows you the confidence to make smarter management decisions.

Fully Own Your Website and Content

No ‘managed’ service should ever claim they own your website, domain name or content. We deliver a modern, responsive website always owned by you, content & images & all. We think your website is too important to be renting it.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/b92136e09055985d1cfdc1e4ea77b708.png"},{"description":"Ortho Marketing is a digital marketing agency that works exclusively in the dental industry.

Our goal is to help companies identify their purpose, vision, mission, and values to build a brand with a strong foundation.
A good brand will reshape how you, your employees, and how your customers think and feel about your company. A good brand communicates a clear story. 
Companies with clear stories are valued higher by their customers. Companies with clear stories have employees who understand what they do and why they do it. Companies with clear stories are able to move people’s emotions, which is key to moving sales. 
People want to work for companies that do great things, and great things are only great if they’re understood clearly and simply. People want to buy from companies who do great things- but will only buy what they understand.
When you have a brand that is memorable and a story that is easy to tell and retell to others, you will find more focused success.

In two minutes, we ll show you how you can leverage our potent M.A.D. process to get new customers on autopilot.

 

I m Paul R. Dillinger, CEO & Chief Strategist with 29 years of web development and digital marketing experience.

 

How Our M.A.D. Maximization Method Delivers Apocalypse Proof Results

 

M.A.D. is Messaging, Automation, & Discoverability, but acronyms don t matter. When it s survival of the fittest, who do you want on your side?  M.A.D. Max  turns your business into an unkillable profit-generating machine!

 

Messaging Maximization is about attracting buyers by empathizing with them, focusing on their desires, and making loyal, fervent fans. We grab people by the eyeballs and show them why you re the best.

 

Automation Maximization is about developing processes and systems to work smarter and maximizing the value of every dollar spent.

 

Discoverability Maximization is about putting your brand in front of the RIGHT people at the RIGHT time and being the trendsetter that sets a high bar and dares your competition to try to follow.

 

Sounds great, but hold on! We don t work with everybody.

 

We only work with established businesses that can handle a surge of new buyers.

 

We start with discovery. First, we learn about your business, your existing marketing methods, what s working for you, and the buyers you want to attract.

 

Next, we dig into data, analytics, and analysis. We look at your brand s position among competitors and identify core strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

 

Finally, we meet up with you about a week later with fact-based analysis, fresh perspectives, a detailed strategy showing how to shore up your weaknesses and maximize your advantages, and finally, a menu of solutions we can implement for you.

 

So if $2500 for all that sounds like what you re looking for, reach out. We happily lay our game plan out in front of everyone because NO ONE can do it better than SuccessAmp.Read more...","logo":"https://img.shgstatic.com/clutchco-static/image/scale/50x50/s3fs-public/logos/cb2635fa3b80760c4b5dfdd0eecac760.png"},{"description":"Located in Minneapolis, TheSiteEdge is a web design and SEO company.

We love to design incredible content – written and visual – to make the websites we work on stand out from the crowd. Wherever and whenever we can, we use hard data and cold facts to help guide our decision-making processes.

At True Boost, our philosophy sets us apart from many other agencies. We truly care about businesses, and we want to build a mutually beneficial relationship which enables both parties to flourish. The traditional digital agency business model has many flaws. Usually, the aim is simply to obtain as many paying customers as possible, leading to a lack of care and attention in service delivery. Internal restructures take place inside the agency without any understanding of how this will impact their clients. Service offerings are chopped and changed without a full consultation. This inward-looking approach does nothing to help the client. Instead, we want to transform how a digital marketing agency fits in with a modern-day business. As a small to medium-size business ourselves, we can relate to the challenges faced by similarly sized organizations and understand what it takes to operate in a competitive environment.
